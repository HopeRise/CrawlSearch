It was formed in 2005 as University College for the Creative Arts at Canterbury, Epsom, Farnham, Maidstone and Rochester when the Kent Institute of Art and Design was merged into the Surrey Institute of Art & Design, which already had degree-awarding status;[4] both constituent schools had been formed by merging the local art schools, in Kent and Surrey respectively. It was granted university status in 2008, and the name changed to the present one.[5] History[edit] The origin of the University for the Creative Arts lies in the establishment of various small art schools in the English counties of Kent and Surrey in the nineteenth century. In Kent the first of these was Maidstone College of Art, founded in 1867, and in Surrey the Guildford School of Art, founded in 1856. During the second half of the twentieth century many of these small art schools merged, eventually forming Kent Institute of Art & Design in 1987, and Surrey Institute of Art & Design in 1995. These two organisations joined forces in 2005 to become the University College for the Creative Arts at Canterbury, Epsom, Farnham, Maidstone and Rochester. In May 2008, the University College for the Creative Arts was granted full university status by the Privy Council, and adopted its current name, the University for the Creative Arts, officially in September 2008.[6] In 2016, it merged with the Open College of the Arts.[5] Timeline[edit] 1856 – Guildford School of Art is founded as Guildford Working Men's Institution[7] 1866 – Farnham School of Art is founded[8] 1867 – Maidstone College of Art is founded as Maidstone School of Art[9] 1868 – Canterbury College of Art is founded as the Sidney Cooper School of Art[10] 1886 – Medway College of Design is founded as Rochester School of Art[11][12] 1896 – Epsom School of Art & Design is founded as Epsom Technical Institute & School of Art[13] 1969 – Farnham School of Art and Guildford School of Art merge to form West Surrey College of Art & Design[14] 1979 – West Surrey College of Art & Design moves to a single building in Farnham closing Guildford campus[14] 1987 – Canterbury College of Art, Maidstone College of Art and Medway College of Design merge to form Kent Institute of Art & Design[15] 1995 – Epsom School of Art & Design and West Surrey College of Art & Design merge to form Surrey Institute of Art & Design[16] 1999 – Surrey Institute of Art & Design receives University College Title from the Privy Council and is renamed Surrey Institute of Art & Design, University College[17] 2005 – Kent Institute of Art & Design and Surrey Institute of Art & Design, University College merge to form University College for the Creative Arts at Canterbury, Epsom, Farnham, Maidstone & Rochester[18][19] 2008 – University College for the Creative Arts at Canterbury, Epsom, Farnham, Maidstone & Rochester receives University Title from the Privy Council and is renamed University for the Creative Arts (UCA)[20] 2012 – Maidstone campus sold to MidKent College with final teaching scheduled for 2014.[21] 2020 – Xiamen University and UCA open The Institute of Creativity and Innovation in China[22] 2023 – Rochester Campus closed[23] Campuses[edit] University for the Creative Arts, Epsom campus UCA has campuses in Canterbury, Epsom and Farnham, plus a teaching base at The Maidstone Studios,[24] and a project and exhibition space in Folkestone Creative Quarter.[25] It previously had a campus in Maidstone (closed in 2014) and another in Rochester (closed in 2023).[26][27] The university also validates provision at, or co-delivers courses with, a number of other educational institutions and arts organisations in the UK: Farnham Maltings, London College of Contemporary Arts, London College of Creative Media, London School of Design & Marketing, and London Studio Centre.[28] UCA works in partnership with several institutions globally, validating courses for: Berlin School Business & Innovation (Germany), Cyprus Academy of Arts (Cyprus), Hong Kong Management Associations (Hong Kong), The Millennium Universal College (Pakistan), and UK Creative Art and Design Centre (South Korea).[28] In 2019, UCA and Xiamen University partnered to establish the Institute of Creativity and Innovation, with the Institute opening its doors in September 2020.[29] UCA Canterbury[edit] UCA Canterbury is home to architecture, interior design, automotive design, industrial and product design, fine art and visual communications courses.

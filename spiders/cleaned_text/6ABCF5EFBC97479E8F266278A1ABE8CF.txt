Killing ten people, injuring 84 people, and causing $126.05 million in damage, the tornado reached a peak width of 1,320 yd (1,210 m). The tornado was a part of a significant four-day tornado outbreak that span from April 27 to April 30 and was the second strongest tornado of the outbreak, reaching an estimated peak winds of 185 mph (298 km/h), the strongest being the violent and long-tracked EF4 tornado that tracked through central Arkansas the previous day.[1] The tornado touched down in northern Leake County, quickly intensifying to high-end EF2, damaging or destroying homes and snapping trees. After weakening slightly, the tornado quickly intensified to EF3 strength, destroying chicken farms, damaging homes, and snapping trees. The tornado became violent as trees were shredded and more metal buildings were destroyed. The tornado continued to inflict significant to violent damage, damaging or destroying homes, demolishing metal building systems, and razing numerous trees, The tornado weakened down, continuing to destroyed chicken homes and damaging several more homes as the tornado entered Louisville. The tornado intensified to low-end EF4 intensity, inflicting severe damage to several industrial buildings and destroying numerous homes. For the remainder of the path; an apartment complex was destroyed, homes were mostly damaged or destroyed, several businesses were demolished, and extensive forestry damage occurred. The tornado dissipated northeast of Louisville. Over 300 homes and businesses were destroyed and hundreds were left homeless. Governor of Mississippi Phil Bryant issued a state of emergency for the state prior to the tornado outbreak. President Barack Obama declared a major disaster for Mississippi after the severe weather event. Mississippi National Guardsmen were deployed to towns and communities affected by the tornado outbreak, including Louisville, and a temporary medical care facility was setup as the town's hospital was severely damaged. Several non-profits organizations, including the Samaritan's Purse, assisted in the recovery efforts across multiple states, distributing meals and other essential supplies. Afterwards, Louisville and other areas received federal grants to assist in the rebuilding efforts, including a law Governor Bryant passed that gave millions to Louisville. Over the next few years after the tornado, several businesses and homes were rebuilt, including the Winston Medical Center and a plywood manufacturing plant, as federal grants were allocated to the city and the county over those few years. Meteorological synopsis[edit] Main article: Tornado outbreak of April 27–30, 2014 § Meteorological synopsis High risk convective outlook issued by the Storm Prediction Center at 19:19 UTC on April 28 On April 23, the Storm Prediction Center (SPC) issued a day 6 outlook for potential severe weather, with the SPC noting that a significant, multi-day severe weather event was expected from the central to southern plains to across Dixie Alley. Expectations were that a surface front and dryline should advance into the Mississippi Valley, where several supercells could evolve ahead of the front from Louisiana to as far east as central Tennessee, with tornadoes and large hail possible with the warm sector convection.[2] On April 24, a deep surface cyclone was forecasted to move across easterly through the central plains, and curving frontal position should extend along the Kansas-Missouri border and into southern Texas. Severe thunderstorms development was expected across the warm sector, with winds of 80 knots at the 500mb level ejecting across the lower Mississippi Valley into western Tennessee during Monday.[3] On April 26, a day three moderate risk was issued for a region extending from southwestern Kentucky to central Mississippi. A large, upper-level trough was expected to stall over the central United States, with mid-level speed max at 80 knots ejecting into parts of the mid-south and the convergence point of the Mississippi River and Ohio River by the afternoon of April 28. Dew points reaching into the 60s was expected to be constant across the warm front extending from the Midwest to the Gulf Coast, persisting due to strong low-level shear. Strong diurnal heating was forecasted to occur in areas lacking convective activity to support moderate buoyancy over large parts of the warm sector by the afternoon hours. Low to deep-layer shear was expected to be strong due to the mid-level speed max. The SPC noted that parts of the lower Mississippi Valley had the greatest risk for a high-end severe risk, with numerous storms likely over the area possibly stemming from the regenerative convective clusters along the dryline and convective outflow. With strong wind shear and surface dew points reaching into the mid-upper 60s, several supercells and significant tornadoes were likely, along with large hail and damaging winds.[4] On April 28, morning storms that were present over Mississippi, Alabama, and Tennessee began dissipating overtime, leaving a well-defined outflow boundary across south-central Tennessee and more diffuse across the northern parts of Mississippi and Alabama. The morning storms dissipating also allowed strong surface heating to start across Louisiana and southwest Mississippi, with further clearing expected to occur. By the afternoon, weakening convective inhibition allowed storm development along or east of the outflow boundary. Mid-level convective available potential energy (CAPE) was expected to be near 2,000 j/kg, with strong bulk shear of 50-60 knots, storm-relative helicity at 200-300 ms2/s2, and subtle forcing favored a discrete or cluster supercells mode. With all these variables, at 2:19 p.m. CDT, the SPC upgraded to a high risk for most of central Mississippi and parts of Alabama, accompanied by a 30 hatched risk for strong to violent tornadoes.[5] At 12:40 p.m. CDT, a particularly dangerous situation tornado watch was issued most of Mississippi, parts of Louisiana, Alabama, and southern Tennessee, with some long-lived supercells capable of producing strong and long-tracked tornadoes. The tornado watch noted that surface based storm were beginning to develop in Louisiana and Mississippi as more clearing occurred and atmospheric destabilization continued, a combination of a moderate ML CAPE and strong deep vertical wind shear supported a broken band of supercells, with an increase in low-level shear expected across central Mississippi, northwest Alabama, and southern Tennessee along the outflow boundary.[6] By 3:49 p.m. CDT, numerous discrete and cluster supercells were moving northwest from central Mississippi into northwest Alabama, with the damaging Tupelo EF3 tornado already occurring within the past hour as more discrete supercells initiated south into central Mississippi, suggesting that these storms will more likely remain separated for a few more hours, increasing support for long-tracked and significant tornadoes. Local observations showed an expected strengthening of the wind profiles and additional support from the low-level flow associated with surface pressure deepening, boosting storm relative helicity. Strong to violent tornado damage was expected over the next few hours with the most potent supercells.[6] Tornado summary[edit] Formation and initial damage[edit] The tornado touched down north of Coosa in Leake County at 3:51 p.m. CDT, snapping and uprooting several softwood trees at mid-range EF1 intensity. The tornado intensified to high-end EF2 strength, with estimated windspeeds of 130 mph (210 km/h). A mobile home along McGee Town Road was destroyed, three vehicles were thrown and trees were downed. The tornado crossed Highway 25, maintaining high-end EF2 intensity. A metal building system experienced complete destruction. Two homes had majority of their roof ripped, another home nearby had parts of their roof torn off, numerous trees snapped and uprooted and an outbuilding nearby was demolished. The tornado crossed Highway 19, snapping several softwood trees and cause roof damage to a home.[7][8] At 3:58 p.m. CDT, the National Weather Service office in Jackson, Mississippi issued a radar indicated particularly dangerous situation tornado warning for Attala, Neshoba, and Winston counties.[9] The tornado weakened to high-end EF1 strength, traversing through rural areas of southern Winston County, snapping and uprooting several trees and overturning a motor home. At the same time, storm chasers reported that a large, multi-vortex tornado was on the ground. With the confirmation that a large and potentially violent tornado was on the ground, NWS upgraded the PDS tornado warning to a tornado emergency for the same aforementioned counties at 4:03 p.m. CDT.[9] Then the tornado intensified slightly, snapping several softwood trees at EF2 intensity along Walter Sisson Road The tornado turned northeast and crossed Goldman Road, quickly intensifying to mid-range EF3 strength.[7] Peak intensity track and through Louisville[edit] Numerous chicken houses were completely demolished, a one-story brick home along the road was completely unroofed, with parts of the exterior walls collapsing, another home nearby had their roof ripped away and trees were knocked down. The tornado weakened slightly, crossing Plattsburg Road at low-end EF3 intensity. A large home was unroofed and had its exterior walls torn down, with several other homes experiencing significant damage from the tornado. The tornado then abruptly intensified to low-end EF4 strength for the first time as it crossed Hartness Road. Violent forestry damage was inflicted as numerous debarked trees were extensively debarked. Nearby, 12 metal chicken homes were flattened and swept clean off their foundations, and another chicken home was destroyed. The tornado weakened to high-end EF2 intensity, completely ripping away a roof off a home, a double-wide mobile home was destroyed, and several trees and power poles were snapped and toppled over.[7] Well-built brick home swept away at mid-range EF4 intensity. The tornado strengthened again to low-end EF4 strength, destroying several more chicken houses at windspeeds of 170 mph (270 km/h) and significantly snapping nearby trees. A guide cell tower nearby was crumpled, with the damage indicator being rated mid-range EF3, though surveyors noted that winds may have been higher. Then, the tornado impacted a small row of homes along Stanley Road, intensifying to peak strength of 185 mph (298 km/h). A brick home was flatten and swept away, leaving the chimney standing. Another well-constructed brick home nearby was demolished and swept clean, with heavy tree damage nearby. Several softwood trees nearby the peak damage indicator were shredded and heavily debarked, a double-wide mobile home was destroyed, and more trees were snapped. The tornado weakened to low-end EF3 intensity, flattening a chicken house, with trees and power poles nearby snapping.[7] The tornado weakened to high-end EF2 intensity as the tornado turned more northerly. Crossing Young Crossing Road, two double-wide mobile homes were completely demolished, a few brick homes was completely unroofed, couple other double mobile homes were rolled and destroyed, and several softwood trees were snapped. After weakening slightly, the tornado intensified to high-end EF2 strength, a home along Emepa Road had large sections of its roof ripped away. The tornado then struck a neighborhood near Highway 15 at high-end EF3 intensity. Several homes experience heavy destruction, with a few of them leveled and swept away. The tornado intensified further to low-end EF4 strength, impacting the Taylor Machine Works, destroying parts of the building. The tornado maintained low-end EF4 intensity as it impacts the Winston Plywood & Veneer plant, leveling two metal industrial buildings and destroying the plywood mill on site.[7][10] Then the tornado impacts a neighborhood along Eiland Avenue, inflicting major destruction to this subdivision at high-end EF3 intensity. Several homes were heavily damaged or destroyed, multiple cars were tossed into pile ups, and an industrial building was destroyed, two fatalities occurred in this area; a 64-year-old woman was killed here after saving her grandson as their home was swept away, and 61-year-old man was found injured, but later succumbed to his injuries at the University of Mississippi Medical Center.[7][11][12] Two apartment buildings swept away at low-end EF4 intensity. The Eiland Plaza Apartments was majorly impacted by the tornado as it struck at estimated windspeeds of 175 mph (282 km/h). Several apartment buildings were heavily damaged or completely flattened, with two buildings in particular being swept clean off their foundations, two fatalities occurred in the apartment complexes.[13][12] Nearby, the Calvary Apostolic Church was leveled by the tornado, with the church's fellowship hall and clinic being destroyed as well.[14] The Mount Bethel Olive Harmony Branch Association building was destroyed at high-end EF3 strength, with the entire metal building being completely flattened. The Louisville Memorial Park took a direct hit from the tornado. Headstones in the cemetery were shifted or completely shattered as the tornado continued off northeast.[15] The tornado maintained high-end EF3 intensity, impacting a row of homes along Cox Road. A well-constructed brick home was leveled and swept away at 165 mph (266 km/h), a double-wide mobile home was demolished, with the frame wrapped around a tree, multiple softwood trees were debarked and denubbed severely, and several other homes were heavily damaged, with some losing their exterior walls, and power poles were snapped. The Winston Medical Center was severely impacted by the tornado as it struck at low-end EF3 intensity. Multiple walls of the hospital were knocked down or damaged, facade components of the structure were torn off, and gas leak occurred as a result of the damaged inflicted by the tornado. Around the hospital, cars were flipped and thrown, power poles were snapped, and numerous trees were snapped. 125 patients, visitors, and staff were in hospital rooms when the tornado struck, though the hospital reported no deaths, few people were injured.[7][16] The tornado maintained intensity, crossing the road and hitting another row of homes and businesses at low-end EF3 intensity. An automobile showroom was completely destroyed, with a nearby building also experiencing complete destruction. Nearby, a daycare center was completely swept off its foundation, the owner, a 53-year-old woman, was killed as she protected a 4-year-old girl from the tornado as it struck the building.[17] Continuing afterwards, the tornado struck a home along McCullough Road, tearing away the roof and knocking down walls at low-end EF3 intensity. The tornado then leveled two poorly constructed brick and wooden framed homes further north and snapped numerous trees nearby the destroyed structures, with estimated windspeeds of 145 mph (233 km/h).[7][18] Weakening and dissipation[edit] Well-constructed home completely swept away at high-end EF3 intensity. Along the road, a large, well-built brick home was heavily damaged by the tornado, with parts of the roof ripped away. Several other homes nearby also experienced significant damage. Another brick-framed home was also heavily damaged, with other homes also damaged, and numerous trees were snapped, with some of them being debarked. Then the tornado struck a row of homes at high-end EF3 intensity, with estimated windspeeds of 165 mph (266 km/h). A well-constructed home was completely swept clean off its foundation, with several trees nearby being heavily damaged, with some being debarked. Two other brick homes were also heavily destroyed, leaving a few interior walls left, and several trees were snapped and uprooted, with one uprooted tree being thrown 50 yd (46 m) away. The tornado weakened slightly, striking a line of homes along Richardson Road at windspeeds of 150 mph (240 km/h). Several homes were heavily damaged, with a few homes having parts of their interior walls left, a shed was destroyed, and trees were snapped. Then the tornado struck a neighborhood along Wood Street, inflicting heavy destruction to several homes. Multiple homes were heavily damaged or destroyed, trees were splintered, and pile of debris were strewn across the ground.[7][19] At the intersection of Brooksville and McCullough Roads, the tornado intensified to low-end EF4 strength. Two large homes were almost completely destroyed, leaving some walls standing. Several other homes were heavily damaged, with some leveled or swept away, and numerous hardwood trees and power poles were snapped. The tornado weakened slightly to high-end EF3, leveling a well-built home. Another home was heavily damaged, with its roof being torn off and parts of the exterior walls collapsing, and numerous trees were snapped. The tornado lifted at 4:47 p.m. CDT few miles north-northeast of Louisville as a separate cell from the south began interacting and merging with the tornado's parent supercell, leading to the tornado's dissipation. The tornado was on the ground for 57 minutes, traveling 34.38 miles (55.33 km) and reaching a peak width of 1,320 yd (1,210 m).[18][7] A whole door was thrown 30 miles (48 km) away from Louisville onto the Mississippi State University campus in Starkville.[20] Impacts & aftermath[edit] In Leake County, the tornado inflicted $1.2 million in property damage, $2.2 million in vegetation damage and resulting in three injuries.[8] In Neshoba County, the tornado inflicted $400,000 in property damage and $750,000 in vegetation damage.[21] The most heavily affected county was Winston County, the tornado inflicted $115 million in property, $6.5 million in vegetation damage, ten people were killed, and 81 others in the county were injured.[22] In Winston County, 391 structures were destroyed and hundreds were left homeless.[23] Executive director of the Winston County Economic Development Partnership stated that more than 100 people were living in shelters, others were staying with relatives. 40 homes were in sale in Winston County before the tornado occurred, and the town was already facing "critical shortage" of rental options, according to the executive director.[24] The Mississippi Forestry Commission made conducted a storm damage assessment on the forestry damage caused by tornadoes from the severe weather event using aerial detection flight. 31,854 acres of forestry across Mississippi were affected by tornado outbreak, resulting in a timber damage of $14.3 million. In Winston County, 4931 acres of pine trees, 3,398 acres of hardwood trees, 1,440 mixed acres were damaged, resulting in $6.5 million in timber damage in the county. In Private Non-Industrial Landowners areas, 3,877 acres of pine trees, 3,072 acres of hardwood trees, and 1,256 mixed acres were damaged, resulting in $5.5 million damage. The survey noted that these forested areas are unlikely to recover fully as other factors, including insects, diseases, and other stressors, tend to cause further timber damage.[25] Response[edit] Aerial imagery of the Eiland Avenue neighborhood and the industrial park after the tornado the day after. Governor Phil Bryant declared a state of emergency for Mississippi prior to the tornado outbreak, allowing state officials to station and deploy resources to areas affected by the emergency. The State Emergency Operations Center also has been partially activated by critical personnel.[26] The Mississippi National Guard units were deployed to several towns and communities that were impacted by tornadoes from the tornado outbreak, including Louisville, with guardsmen were aiding in the search and rescue efforts of looking for victims still confirmed missing. The National Guard was also patrolling the areas hardest hit by the tornadoes, along with setting up checkpoints and security. Guardsmen and Mississippi Emergency Management Agency were also stationed at the Hawkins Field in Jackson, Mississippi, where medical evacuations and damage assessment were performed at.[27] On April 29, Governor Bryant ordered the deployment of 50 more National Guardsmen for the Tupelo and Louisville area, bringing the total amount of Guardsmen assisting in the disaster areas to 100. Mississippi state emergency officials drove in a mobile emergency room to replace the damaged medical center in Louisville in order to treat injuries.[28] On April 30, President Barack Obama declared a major disaster for Mississippi and ordered federal aid to help with state and local recovery efforts in the area affected by tornadoes, severe storms, and flooding from the severe weather event, with federal funding available for people affected in several counties, including Winston County.[29] On May 6, a temporary care facility was being setup two miles away from the Winston Medical Center along Church Street, with backing from Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). The Mobile Medical facility was transported from North Carolina. The mobile hospital had ten beds, five bed emergency department, an X-ray unit and full surgical capabilities. Essentials like electricity, water and sewer was connected to the mobile medical site, with the hospital expected to be fully operational in about two weeks. The temporary hospital was going to serve patients in the Louisville area until the Winston Medical Center was rebuilt.[30] The City of Louisville set up a distribution center to distribute emergency supplies to tornado victims. The Samaritan's Purse sent out a disaster relief unit and a Billy Graham Evangelistic Association truck to the area to help with victims. On May 6, Phil Bryant's wife, Deborah Bryant, partnered with Samaritan's Purse to volunteer in the recovery efforts, aiding in clearing out debris from residential structures.[31][32] The Salvation Army sent out 18 mobile feeding units across Mississippi and Alabama, delivering food and supplies to several locations. In Louisville, two more additional mobile feeding units were sent out to the area for additional support.[33] Global non-profit organization, AmeriCares, was funding the temporary facility for the Winston County Medical Center that would help keep it in operation during the rebuilding process. The Chief Executive Office of Greater Meridian Health Clinic stated that patients would've drove up to 30 miles (48 km) to receive care without the help from AmeriCares as the clinic was destroyed by the tornado.[34] The University of Mississippi Medical Center (UMMC) in Jackson, Mississippi, sent emergency responders, care providers and medical equipment to help attend and assist with tornado. Med-Com, UMMC-based medical communications hub for Mississippi, began supporting local emergency management services and hospital providers by coordinating ambulances of patients to hospital. Med-Com also played a role in relaying damage reports and real-time information to agencies like Mississippi State Department of Health and MEMA. With the likelihood of serious injuries, Chief Executive Office and other leaders activated UMMC's Emergency Operations Plan, which allowed adult and pediatric trauma rooms, Emergency Department capacity and operating rooms to be sent over. The Forward Assessment and Scene Triage (FAST) Team, a team of three, traveled to Louisville to assist local emergency responders and health-care workers to classify victims and clear the damaged hospital.[35] Recovery[edit] On May 12, the Mississippi Legislature was met in a three-hour session to approved $17 million to help pay for the recovery from disasters, including the tornado outbreak that occurred recently. Governor Bryant signed the funding measure, Senate Bill 2001, into law. Governor Bryant originally requested lawmakers $20 million of funding, but officials stated $17 million was enough to cover costs until January, when the Legislature begins its 2015 session.[36] The Norman Regional Health System in Oklahoma donated $48,000 to the Winston County Medical Center, with the president and CEO of the Norman Regional Health stating that the company wanted to help employees that were impacted by the tornado. The donation was divided among the employees, according to the CEO of the Winston Medical Center. The city of Louisville received $10 million in insurance check to cover the destruction of the plywood facility, with officials clarifying that the $10 million only covers the cost of real estate. Money has been recovered yet for the loss of equipment due to the storm. The plywood company leased the building from the city.[37] In September, Winston County Medical Foundation received an $1.09 million grant from FEMA. On October 23, Republican Senator Roger Wicker and Thad Cochran, along with Representative Alan Nunnelee approved $43.5 million in federal grants to help rebuild areas damaged by the tornado in Louisville and Winston County, with $34.5 million directed to the rebuilding of the plywood manufacturing plant. That reward will reimburse 75% of the cost to rebuild the plywood plant. FEMA informed the lawmakers that four FEMA Public Assistance grants have been approved to offset costs of the recovery efforts. Three other grants that totaled $10.8 million was linked to the work of restoring medical care services to Winston County. A $4.9 million grant and $4.8 million grant were awarded to Winston County, supporting the replacement of two county-owned warehouses, including one removed to accommodate a mobile disaster hospital. MEMA received $1 million to redirect costs for emergency protective maneuvers that has been taken to restore medical care service, with Mississippi State Department of Health and other medical services organizations coordinating the effort.[38] On December 1, 2015, Senators Roger Wicker and Thad Cochran announced an extra $1.78 million federal grant to continue support the restoration of health care facilities in Louisville and Winston County. The FEMA public assistance grant to the Winston County Medical Foundation was expected to continue supporting the replacement of four buildings and fund other repairs at the Winston County Medical Complex. The grant represented a 75% share of the total cost of the recovery effort in Winston County during this phase, which was $2.38 million.[39] On September 29, 2016, an investigation conducted by the Office of Inspector General discovered that the city, despite following the federal regulations and guidelines by FEMA when accounting for federal funding, failed in following the federal procurement standards in granting 12 contracts, totaling $23.9 million. The investigation also reported that the city also failed to take the necessary steps to use disadvantage firms, not providing a full and open competition for a project management contract that totaled $600,000. Louisville reported receiving funding from other federal sources, but FEMA had not reduced eligible costs to $1.5 million, resulting in duplication of benefits. The report recommend FEMA to dismiss $25.4 million in ineligible costs and direct the state of Mississippi to provide additional technical aid and monitoring to Louisville.[40] After the report, Mayor of Louisville, Will Hill, stated that the city didn't own any money to FEMA during a meeting, with him stating that the audit discovered mistakes the city made, but didn't warrant any reduction in obligations for contracts. The city was $11 million underbudget in recovery. according to Mayor Hill.[41] For 11 months after the tornado, the hospital operated from tent units. Then in April 2015, it transferred to a transitional facility consisting of modular trailers. At the same time, because of the heavy damage sustained, demolition of the old Winston Medical Center building began. This was July 2015, a year after the tornado, and the demolition project was completed in 90 days. The design and construction of the new replacement facility was estimated to cost $55 million. On April 28, 2017, three years after the tornado, the new facility opened to the public, with over 1,000 people attending the ribbon-cutting ceremony. The new facility covers all the services from the previous building, including inpatient, outpatient, radiology, laboratory, geri-psychiatric, respiratory, pharmacy, emergency department and swing bed services. The nursing home units were also rebuilt after being heavily damaged by the tornado.[16][42] In response to the tornado, the construction of the Louisville Community Safe Room began and was finished in 2019, with cost of construction reaching $3.1 million. The Safe Room was a FEMA P-361 and International Code Council (ICC)-500 rated storm shelter that could hold up to 2,218 people during severe weather, the monolithic dome also serves a community center for Louisville. The entire structure was 12,670 square feet, with a single, large room and restrooms and storages on one side. All doors are storm rated and open when there is a tornado warning.[43] See also[edit] List of F4 and EF4 tornadoes (2010–2019) Weather of 2014 References[edit] ^ "April 27 - 29th Tornado Outbreak". weatherworksinc.com.

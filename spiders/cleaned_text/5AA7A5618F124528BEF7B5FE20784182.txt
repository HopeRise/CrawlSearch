Jenny Powell replaced Fielding for the final part of the series. The first two series were produced at The Maidstone Studios before moving to the studios of Scottish Television in Glasgow for the final series. Format[edit] The series included a variety of characters such as Simon Perry, Colin, Wooly, Billy Box, Baljit, Pasty the Worm, Mister Spanky, Naughty Torty, Gaston, Sam Sam, and the wolves Bro and Bro. What's Up Doc? was designed to promote and feature products created by Warner Bros. in the UK which included video games, movies, tours of their studios, and their vast library of Looney Tunes animated shorts from which the "What's up Doc?" catchphrase was derived, and new animated series; Animaniacs, Batman: The Animated Series and Taz-Mania. What's Up Doc? made use of the "phone-in" game format made popular by BBC mainstays such as Going Live!. Phone-in games that featured on the programme included Hugo the Troll and Joe Razz. The show was also responsible for the success of Batman: The Animated Series and Animaniacs on terrestrial television. Music was a large part of the show and played a role in launching the careers of music groups Take That, East 17 and Eternal.[citation needed] What's Up Doc? featured puppet comedian duo Don Austen and John Eccleston as the show's central new puppet characters, a pair of wolf brothers named Bro and Bro who would comically "devour" any celebrity guest on the losing side of the phone-in games. Despite its initial success, the Independent Television Commission later expressed concerns about the anarchic humour of What's Up Doc? which was often considered insensitive for a Saturday morning children's programme. Concerned that Warner Bros. would pull the plug on their involvement with the show, Scottish TV requested that the show's humour be toned down to an acceptable level. The show's producers refused and eventually resigned at the end of the second series, along with many of its cast including Austen and Eccleston who were given a spin-off series, Wolf It, also on Children's ITV. The third series saw production move to Scottish Television's own studios in Glasgow, but without much of its original cast. A decline in ratings led to the show being cancelled in April 1995.

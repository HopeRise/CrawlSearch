Essential workers for the government, utilities, and media were exempted, as were health care providers and suppliers. The airport remained open, but only essential travel was allowed on public buses.[11] April 2020[edit] On 5 April, the Queen of the Bahamas addressed the Commonwealth in a televised broadcast, in which she asked people to "take comfort that while we may have more still to endure, better days will return". She added, "we will be with our friends again; we will be with our families again; we will meet again".[12] On April 19, the prime minister announced that wearing a mask or covering one's face with clothing is mandatory in public. Employers must provide their employees who are serving the general public with masks.[13] May 2020[edit] On May 21, authorities are maintaining various restrictions across the islands in order to slow the spread of COVID-19. A daily 24-hour curfew on weekdays and weekend lockdowns are from 2100 on Fridays to 0500 on Mondays. The island of Bimini is under complete lockdown at least through May 30. Under the 24 hour curfew, the residents can only leave their homes for essential purposes or for an emergency.[14] Cases by islands[edit] Islands Cases[15] Deaths References Abaco 659 Acklins 28 Andros 293 Berry Islands 111 Bimini & Cat Cay 238 [16] Cat Island 99 Crooked Island 33 Eleuthera 711 Exuma 366 Grand Bahama 2,632 Inagua 61 Long Island 114 Mayaguana 21 [17] New Providence San Salvador 16 Locations Pending Totals 23,380 Last update 22 December,[18] 2021 Statistics[edit] New cases and deaths per day[edit] No. of casesDate010020030040050060011 Mar 202017 Sep 202026 Mar 2021New cases per dayNew cases of COVID-19 per day in the Bahamas View source data.

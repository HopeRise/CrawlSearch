Location[edit] Hertford North is about ten minutes walk from the town centre in North Road and opened on 2 June 1924, replacing the similarly named station (known until 1923 as Hertford Cowbridge) on the branch from Hatfield.[2] It is 19 miles 48 chains (19.60 miles, 31.54 km) down the line from London King's Cross on the Hertford Loop Line[3] which provides a diversion from the East Coast Main Line from Alexandra Palace to Langley Junction just south of Stevenage. Stations on the line include Stevenage, Watton-at-Stone, Bayford and Cuffley. Trains on this line are run by Great Northern. The station has one terminal and two through platforms and features a lift (to platforms 2 and 3), a small shop, two ticket booths and ticket barriers. There is no lift or other step-free access to platform 1. Platform layout[edit] Platform 1 is mainly used for trains to Moorgate, originating in Stevenage. Platform 2 is mainly used for trains originating in London proceeding north to Stevenage. Platform 3 is a bay platform used only as a terminus for trains from London. Services[edit] All services at Hertford North are operated by Great Northern using Class 717 EMUs. The typical off-peak service in trains per hour is:[4] 2 tph to Moorgate 2 tph to Stevenage Additional services originate or terminate at the station during weekday peak hours, when services increase to 4 tph to/from Moorgate. A few trains also originate here in the early morning and end here in the evening.

Prior to the ratification of the Seventeenth Amendment in 1913, Arkansas senators were elected by the Arkansas General Assembly; afterwards, senators were elected directly by the people of the state.[5] Each state elects at least one member of the House to a two-year term. The number of House members is proportional to the state's share of the national population, and changes every ten years with the results of the United States Census.[6][7] Arkansas's representation began with one representative immediately after statehood, and peaked from 1903 to 1953 following the 1900 United States census, with seven seats in the House. Arkansas has sent four members to the House in each congressional delegation since 1963.[8] As a senator for 34 years, from 1942 to 1977, John L. McClellan was the longest-serving senator to represent Arkansas in Congress.[9] The current dean, or longest-serving incumbent, of Arkansas's congressional delegation is senator John Boozman, who has represented Arkansas in Congress since 2001.[10] While Arkansas politics was dominated by the Democratic Party from the 1870s to the 1960s, Arkansas's current delegation consists entirely of Republicans. Some scholars consider the 2010 elections the beginning of the modern rise of the Arkansas Republican Party.[11] Current delegation[edit] Current U.S. senators from Arkansas Arkansas CPVI (2025):[12] R+15 Class II senator Class III senator Tom Cotton(Junior senator)(Little Rock) John Boozman(Senior senator)(Rogers) Party Republican Republican Incumbent since January 3, 2015 January 3, 2011 Arkansas's current congressional delegation in the 119th Congress consists of two senators and four representatives, all of whom are Republicans. The state has had four representatives in the House since 1963, following the 1960 census.[4]: 41  The current dean, or longest-serving incumbent,[13] of the Arkansas delegation is Senator John Boozman, who has represented Arkansas in the Senate since 2011 and in Congress since 2001.[10] The Cook Partisan Voting Index (CPVI) is a measure of how strongly partisan a state is.[14]: 274  For each district or state, the CPVI measures the party leaning (Democratic or Republican) and the number of percentage points more partisan than the national average. For instance, a rating of R+4 would mean the district or state voted four percentage points more Republican than the national average, while a rating of D+9 would mean the district or state voted nine points more Democratic than the national average.[15] As of 2025, the CPVI rated all four districts in Arkansas as leaning Republican, with the 1st district, represented by Rick Crawford in the House, leaning most heavily at R+23, and the 2nd district, represented by French Hill in the House, leaning the least at R+8.[16] The CPVI gave Arkansas an R+15 rating as a whole.[12] Current U.S. representatives from Arkansas District Member(Residence)[17] Party Incumbent since CPVI(2025)[16] District map 1st Rick Crawford(Jonesboro) Republican January 3, 2011[18] R+23 2nd French Hill(Little Rock) Republican January 3, 2015[19] R+8 3rd Steve Womack(Rogers) Republican January 3, 2011[20] R+13 4th Bruce Westerman(Hot Springs) Republican January 3, 2015[21] R+20 United States Senate[edit] Main article: List of United States senators from Arkansas Hattie Caraway, Arkansas senator who was the first woman to be elected to the United States Senate for a full term John McClellan, the longest-serving senator from Arkansas, who chaired the Senate Committee on Government Operations and Senate Appropriations Committee during his 34 years in office J. William Fulbright, Arkansas senator known for the Fulbright Program, his work as the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and his opposition to the civil rights movement 35 people have served as a U.S. senator from Arkansas, consisting of 33 men and two women, as well as 28 Democrats and 7 Republicans.[9] Two, William K. Sebastian and Charles B. Mitchel, were expelled from the Senate because of Arkansas's secession from the Union at the start of the American Civil War; Sebastian was the only senator from a Confederate state to later be reinstated, albeit posthumously.[22]: 95–98  After her husband's death in office, Hattie Caraway, became the first woman to be elected to a full term in the Senate, after finishing his term.[23]: 123  The longest-serving senator from Arkansas, John L. McClellan, chaired many Senate committees during his 34 years in office, including the Senate Committee on Government Operations and the Senate Appropriations Committee.[9][24] For some time, he served with J. William Fulbright, known for the Fulbright Program, establishing an American student exchange program; his chairing of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, resulting in the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution and Fulbright hearings; and his opposition to the civil rights movement.[25]: 21–22 [26] Other senators from Arkansas also served in leadership roles in the Senate, including Joseph T. Robinson, who served as Senate Majority Leader,[27] and Ambrose Sevier and James P. Clarke, who both served as president pro tempore of the Senate.[3] Senators are elected every six years depending on their class, with each senator serving a six-year term and elections for senators occurring every two years; the class up for re-election rotates such that each election, around one-third of the seats in the Senate are up for election.[28] Arkansas's senators are elected in classes II and III. Currently, Arkansas is represented in the Senate by Tom Cotton and John Boozman.[29] Democratic (D) Jacksonian (J) Republican (R) Senators from Arkansas[29] Class II senator Congress Class III senator William S.

Robert Ward Johnson, who previously served as both a representative and senator from Arkansas, and Albert Rust, who was a sitting member of Congress from Arkansas during secession, both later served in the Confederate Congress.[2]: 228–229, 231–232 Many representatives from Arkansas have held leadership roles in the House. William A. Oldfield served as the House Minority Whip for the Democratic Party.[45] Wilbur Mills was elected in 1938, serving as the powerful chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee from 1957 until his retirement in 1977, following scandals related to his alcoholism and an affair with stripper Fanne Foxe.[46]: 1 [47] Some representatives have gone on to serve in other political and judicial offices after their time in Congress, including Thomas C. McRae, who later served as governor of Arkansas;[48]: 1  Tim Griffin, who later served as lieutenant governor of Arkansas;[49] Asa Hutchinson, who later became governor of Arkansas and led both the Drug Enforcement Administration and part of the Department of Homeland Security;[50] and Ray Thornton, who later served on the Arkansas Supreme Court.[51] Each district uses a popular vote to elect a member of Arkansas's delegation in the House of Representatives.[6] Districts are redrawn every ten years, after data from the US Census is collected.[52] While it has sent varying numbers of representatives to Congress over the years, Arkansas has sent four representatives to the House since 1963, following the 1960 United States census.[8] Arkansas is currently represented in the House by four Republicans: Rick Crawford, French Hill, Steve Womack, and Bruce Westerman.

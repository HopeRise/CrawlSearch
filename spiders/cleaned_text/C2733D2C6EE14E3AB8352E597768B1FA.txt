Prior to her casting on the soap, Bibby appeared in episodes of Doctors and Brassic. Life and career[edit] Harriet Anne Bibby was born on 27 April 1998 in Market Rasen, Lincolnshire.[1] She attended the De Aston School, where she featured in school theatre productions and eventually got into the National Youth Theatre summer school programme. After leaving De Aston, she attended the Academy of Live and Recorded Arts (ALRA), where she obtained a BA in acting.[2] Whilst studying at ALRA, she appeared in various stage productions, including Oppenheimer and Game.[3] Bibby made her television debut in a 2020 episode of the BBC soap opera Doctors, where she portrayed Clara Bindon.[4] She then appeared in an episode of the Sky series Brassic.[5] In 2020, Bibby was cast in the ITV1 soap opera Coronation Street as Summer Spellman.[6] The role was previously played by Matilda Freeman, who had decided to leave the role earlier that year.[7] She was 22 when she was cast as the 16-year-old character, accrediting her casting to her "baby face".[8] After being cast as Summer, Bibby moved to Manchester with her sister.[2] A year into her tenure, Bibby was nominated for Best Newcomer at the 2021 Inside Soap Awards.[2] Then in 2022, she was nominated for a National Television Award.[9] In July 2022, Bibby took a break from the soap to appear in the theatre production Blackbird. She was meant to appear in the play prior to joining Coronation Street but it was postponed due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on theatre.[10] Also alongside her role on Coronation Street, Bibby works as a musical theatre teacher for children on Saturdays, due to enjoying them as a child.[11] Filmography[edit] Year Title Role Notes Ref. 2020 Doctors Clara Bindon Episode: "Cul-de-Sac" [6] 2020–present Coronation Street Summer Spellman Regular role [6] 2021 Brassic Kaden's Mum 1 episode [6] 2022 The Masked Dancer Summer Spellman 1 episode [12] Stage[edit] Year Title Role Venue Ref. 2018 The Threepenny Opera Beggar Octagon Theatre [3] 2018 Game Liam ALRA [3] 2018 Oppenheimer Jean Tatlock ALRA [3] 2019 Cannibals Lizaveta ALRA [3] 2022 Blackbird Girl Royal Court Theatre [13] Awards and nominations[edit] Year Award Category Nominated work Result Ref. 2021 Inside Soap Awards Best Newcomer Coronation Street Nominated [14] 2022 National Television Awards Serial Drama Performance Coronation Street Nominated [15] References[edit] ^ Franklin, Ashley (27 October 2020).

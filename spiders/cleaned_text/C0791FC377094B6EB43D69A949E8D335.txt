Grignard reagents or Grignard compounds are chemical compounds with the general formula RMgX(S)n, where X is a halide, R is an organic group (normally an alkyl or aryl), S is an ether, and n is usually 2. Usually, the ether groups are omitted from the formula. Thus, two typical examples are methylmagnesium chloride ClMgCH3 and phenylmagnesium bromide C6H5MgBr. They are a subclass of the organomagnesium compounds. Grignard compounds are popular reagents in organic synthesis for creating new carbon–carbon bonds. The carbon-magnesium bond in Grignard reagent is a polar covalent bond. The carbon atom has negative excess charge and acts as a nucleophile. Grignard reagents are rarely isolated as solids. Instead, they are normally handled as solutions in solvents such as diethyl ether or tetrahydrofuran using air-free techniques. Grignard reagents are complexes with the magnesium atom bonded to two ether ligands as well as the halide and organyl ligands. The discovery of the Grignard reaction in 1900 was recognized with the Nobel Prize awarded to Victor Grignard in 1912. Synthesis[edit] From Mg metal[edit] Traditionally Grignard reagents are prepared by treating an organic halide (normally organobromine) with magnesium metal. Ethers are required to stabilize the organomagnesium compound. Water and air, which rapidly destroy the reagent by protonolysis or oxidation, are excluded.[1] Although the reagents still need to be dry, ultrasound can allow Grignard reagents to form in wet solvents by activating the magnesium such that it consumes the water.[2] As is common for reactions involving solids and solution, the formation of Grignard reagents is often subject to an induction period. During this stage, the passivating oxide on the magnesium is removed. After this induction period, the reactions can be highly exothermic. This exothermicity must be considered when a reaction is scaled-up from laboratory to production plant.[3] Most organohalides will work, but carbon-fluorine bonds are generally unreactive, except with specially activated magnesium (through Rieke metals). Magnesium[edit] Typically the reaction to form Grignard reagents involves the use of magnesium ribbon. All magnesium is coated with a passivating layer of magnesium oxide, which inhibits reactions with the organic halide. Many methods have been developed to weaken this passivating layer, thereby exposing highly reactive magnesium to the organic halide. Mechanical methods include crushing of the Mg pieces in situ, rapid stirring, and sonication.[4] Iodine, methyl iodide, and 1,2-dibromoethane are common activating agents. The use of 1,2-dibromoethane is advantageous as its action can be monitored by the observation of bubbles of ethylene. Furthermore, the side-products are innocuous: Mg + BrC2H4Br → C2H4 + MgBr2 The amount of Mg consumed by these activating agents is usually insignificant. When treated with small amounts of mercuric chloride, magnesium pieces become coated with an amalgam, enhancing its reactivity. Addition of preformed Grignard reagent is often used as the initiator and oxidiser Specially activated magnesium, such as Rieke magnesium, circumvents this problem.[5] The oxide layer can also be broken up using ultrasound, using a stirring rod to scratch the oxidized layer off,[6] or by adding a few drops of iodine or 1,2-Diiodoethane. Another option is to use sublimed magnesium or magnesium anthracene.[7] "Rieke magnesium" is prepared by a reduction of an anhydrous magnesium chloride with a potassium: MgCl2 + 2 K → Mg + 2 KCl Mechanism[edit] In terms of mechanism, the reaction proceeds through single electron transfer:[8][9][10] R − X + Mg ⟶ [ R − X ∙ ] − + [ Mg ∙ ] + [ R − X ∙ ] − ⟶ R ∙ + X − R ∙ + [ Mg ∙ ] + ⟶ R − Mg + R − Mg + + X − ⟶ R − MgX {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}{\ce {R-X{}+Mg}}&\longrightarrow {\ce {[R-X^{\bullet }]^{-}{}+[Mg^{\bullet }]+}}\\{\ce {[R-X^{\bullet }]-}}&\longrightarrow {\ce {R^{\bullet }{}+X-}}\\{\ce {R^{\bullet }{}+[Mg^{\bullet }]+}}&\longrightarrow {\ce {R-Mg+}}\\{\ce {R-Mg+{}+X-}}&\longrightarrow {\ce {R-MgX}}\end{aligned}}} Mg transfer reaction (halogen–Mg exchange)[edit] An alternative preparation of Grignard reagents involves transfer of Mg from a preformed Grignard reagent to an organic halide. Other organomagnesium reagents are used as well.[11] This method offers the advantage that the Mg transfer tolerates many functional groups. An illustrative reaction involves isopropylmagnesium chloride and aryl bromide or iodides:[12] i-PrMgCl + ArBr → i-PrCl + ArMgBr From alkylzinc compounds (reductive transmetalation)[edit] A further method to synthesize Grignard reagents involves reaction of Mg with an organozinc compound. This method has been used to make adamantane-based Grignard reagents, which are, due to C-C coupling side reactions, difficult to make by the conventional method from the alkyl halide and Mg. The reductive transmetalation achieves:[13] AdZnBr + Mg → AdMgBr + Zn Organomagnesium fluorides[edit] Grignard reagents with chloride, bromide, and iodide are routine reagents. The corresponding fluorides RMgF were not synthesized until 1970.[14] In 1920 Swarts reported the reduction of amyl fluoride to the corresponding hydrocarbon with activated magnesium,[15] while no intermediates were separated. Alkylmagnesium fluoride was first prepared by Ashly and co-workers in 1970, using metal magnesium and catalytic iodine in refluxing tetrahydrofuran or 1,2-dimethoxyethane from the corresponding alkyl fluoride.[16][17] Testing Grignard reagents[edit] Because Grignard reagents are so sensitive to moisture and oxygen, many methods have been developed to test the quality of a batch. Typical tests involve titrations with weighable, anhydrous protic reagents, e.g. menthol in the presence of a color-indicator. The interaction of the Grignard reagent with phenanthroline or 2,2'-biquinoline causes a color change.[18] Reactions of Grignard reagents[edit] Grignard reagent reactions Named after Victor Grignard Reaction type Coupling reaction Reaction Carbon electrophiles + R-MgX + (H3O+) ↓ Coupling Product As nucleophiles[edit] Grignard reagents react with a variety of carbonyl derivatives.[19] Reactions of Grignard reagents with carbonyls Such reactions usually involve an aqueous acidic workup, though this step is rarely shown in reaction schemes. The most common application of Grignard reagents is the alkylation of aldehydes and ketones, i.e. the Grignard reaction:[20] Reaction of CH3C(=O)CH(OCH3)2 with H2C=CHMgBr Note that the acetal functional group (a protected carbonyl) does not react. Grignard reagents also react with many "carbonyl-like" electrophiles: Reactions of Grignard reagents with various electrophiles Compounds with labile protons are unsuitable electrophiles, because Grignard reagents are strong bases, and protonative quenching occurs much faster than addition. Grignard reagents are nucleophiles in nucleophilic aliphatic substitutions for instance with alkyl halides in a key step in industrial Naproxen production: Naproxen synthesis In the Bruylants reaction, a nitrile can be replaced by the Grignard nucleophile, rather than the Grignard attacking the nitrile to form an imino structure.[21] Reactions as a base[edit] Grignard reagents are basic and react with alcohols, phenols, etc. to give alkoxides (ROMgBr).[22] 1,3-Diketones and related substrates are also acidic enough that the Grignard reagent RMgX functions merely as a base, liberating the alkane RH to give a magnesium enolate. Alkylation of metals and metalloids[edit] Like organolithium compounds, Grignard reagents usefully form carbon–heteroatom bonds with many metal-based electrophiles.

Grignard reagents react with 1,4-dioxane to give the diorganomagnesium compounds and insoluble coordination polymer MgX2(dioxane)2 and (R = organic group, X = halide): 2 RMgX + dioxane ⇌ R2Mg + MgX2(dioxane)2 This reaction exploits the Schlenk equilibrium, driving it toward the right. Precursors to magnesiates[edit] Grignard reagents react with organolithium compounds to give ate complexes (Bu = butyl):[24] BuMgBr + 3 BuLi → LiMgBu3 + BuBr Coupling with organic halides[edit] Grignard reagents do not typically react with organic halides, in contrast with their high reactivity with other main group halides. In the presence of metal catalysts, however, Grignard reagents participate in C-C coupling reactions. For example, nonylmagnesium bromide reacts with methyl p-chlorobenzoate to give p-nonylbenzoic acid, in the presence of Tris(acetylacetonato)iron(III) (Fe(acac)3), after workup with NaOH to hydrolyze the ester, shown as follows. Without the Fe(acac)3, the Grignard reagent would attack the ester group over the aryl halide.[25] 4-nonylbenzoicacid synthesis using a grignard reagent For the coupling of aryl halides with aryl Grignard reagents, nickel chloride in tetrahydrofuran (THF) is also a good catalyst. Additionally, an effective catalyst for the couplings of alkyl halides is the Gilman catalyst lithium tetrachlorocuprate (Li2CuCl4), prepared by mixing lithium chloride (LiCl) and copper(II) chloride (CuCl2) in THF. The Kumada-Corriu coupling gives access to (substituted) styrenes. Oxidation[edit] Treatment of a Grignard reagent with oxygen gives the magnesium organoperoxide.[citation needed] Hydrolysis of this material yields hydroperoxides or alcohol. These reactions involve radical intermediates. R − MgX + O 2 ⟶ R ∙ + [ O 2 ∙ ] − + MgX + ⟶ R − O − O − MgX + H 3 O + ⟶ R − O − O − H + HO − MgX + H + ↓ R − MgX R − O − MgX + H 3 O + ⟶ R − O − H + HO − MgX + H + {\displaystyle {\begin{array}{lcrll}{\ce {{R-MgX}+O2->}}\ {\color {Red}{\ce {R^{\bullet }{}+[O2^{\bullet }]-}}}+{\ce {MgX+->}}&{\ce {R-O-O-MgX}}&{\color {Gray}+\ {\ce {H3O+}}}&{\ce {->{R-O-O-H}}}&{\color {Gray}+\ {\ce {{HO-MgX}+H+}}}\\&{\Bigg \downarrow }{\ce {R-MgX}}\\&{\ce {R-O-MgX}}&{\color {Gray}+\ {\ce {H3O+}}}&{\ce {->{R-O-H}}}&{\color {Gray}+\ {\ce {{HO-MgX}+H+}}}\\\end{array}}} The simple oxidation of Grignard reagents to give alcohols is of little practical importance as yields are generally poor. In contrast, two-step sequence via a borane (vide supra) that is subsequently oxidized to the alcohol with hydrogen peroxide is of synthetic utility. The synthetic utility of Grignard oxidations can be increased by a reaction of Grignard reagents with oxygen in presence of an alkene to an ethylene extended alcohol.[26] This modification requires aryl or vinyl Grignards. Adding just the Grignard and the alkene does not result in a reaction demonstrating that the presence of oxygen is essential. The only drawback is the requirement of at least two equivalents of Grignard although this can partly be circumvented by the use of a dual Grignard system with a cheap reducing Grignard such as n-butylmagnesium bromide. Grignard oxygen oxidation example Elimination[edit] In the Boord olefin synthesis, the addition of magnesium to certain β-haloethers results in an elimination reaction to the alkene. This reaction can limit the utility of Grignard reactions. Boord olefin synthesis, X = Br, I, M = Mg, Zn Allyl Grignard reagents[edit] Allyl Grignard reagents exhibit high reactivity and special selectivity compared to alkyl ones.[27][28] Industrial use[edit] An example of the Grignard reaction is a key step in the (non-stereoselective) industrial production of Tamoxifen[29] (currently used for the treatment of estrogen receptor positive breast cancer in women):[30] Tamoxifen production See also[edit] Dibutylmagnesium Hauser base Gallery[edit] Magnesium turnings are placed in a flask. Tetrahydrofuran and a small piece of iodine are added. A solution of alkyl bromide is added while heating. After completion of the addition, the mixture is heated for a while. Formation of the Grignard reagent is complete. A small amount of magnesium still remains in the flask. The Grignard reagent thus prepared is cooled to 0°C before the addition of the carbonyl compound. The solution becomes cloudy as the Grignard reagent precipitates out. A solution of carbonyl compound is added to the Grignard reagent. The solution is warmed to room temperature. At this point the reaction is complete. References[edit] ^ Goebel, M. T.; Marvel, C. S.

It catalyzes the following reaction: thiosulfate + cyanide ⇌ {\displaystyle \rightleftharpoons } sulfite + thiocyanate Structure and mechanism[edit] This reaction takes place in two steps. In the first step, thiosulfate is reduced by the thiol group on cysteine-247 1, to form a persulfide and a sulfite 2. In the second step, the persulfide reacts with cyanide to produce thiocyanate, re-generating the cysteine thiol 1.[3] Rhodanese shares evolutionary relationship with a large family of proteins, including: Cdc25 phosphatase catalytic domain non-catalytic domains of eukaryotic dual-specificity MAPK-phosphatases non-catalytic domains of yeast PTP-type MAPK-phosphatases non-catalytic domains of yeast Ubp4, Ubp5, Ubp7 non-catalytic domains of mammalian Ubp-Y Drosophila heat shock protein HSP-67BB several bacterial cold-shock and phage shock proteins plant senescence associated proteins catalytic and non-catalytic domains of rhodanese[4] Rhodanese has an internal duplication. This domain is found as a single copy in other proteins, including phosphatases and ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolases.[5] Clinical relevance[edit] This reaction is important for the treatment of exposure to cyanide, since the thiocyanate formed is around 1 / 200 as toxic.[6]:p. 15938 The use of thiosulfate solution as an antidote for cyanide poisoning is based on the activation of this enzymatic cycle. Human proteins[edit] The human mitochondrial rhodanese gene is TST. The following other human genes match the "Rhodanese-like" domain on InterPro, but are not the rodanase with its catalytic activity (see also the list of related families in #Structure and mechanism): M-phase inducer phosphatase: CDC25A; CDC25B; CDC25C; Dual specificity protein phosphatase: DUSP; DUSP1; DUSP2; DUSP4; DUSP5; DUSP6; DUSP7; DUSP10; DUSP16, aka MKP7; Thiosulfate:glutathione sulfurtransferase: KAT, now known as "TSTD1"; Adenylyltransferase and sulfurtransferase: MOCS3; 3-mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase: MPST, also known as "TSTD2" Not an enzyme: TBCK; TSGA14; Ubiquitin carboxyl-terminal hydrolase: USP8; Unknown activity: TSTD3 Nomenclature[edit] Although the standard nomenclature rules for enzymes indicate that their names are to end with the letters "-ase", rhodanese was first described in 1933,[7] prior to the 1955 establishment of the Enzyme Commission; as such, the older name had already attained widespread usage. The systematic name of this enzyme class is "thiosulfate:cyanide sulfurtransferase". Other names in common use include "thiosulfate cyanide transsulfurase", "thiosulfate thiotransferase", "rhodanese", and "rhodanase". Probably from ῥόδον (ródon), meaning rose, in reference to rhodanic acid which has a red colour with ferric salts.[8] References[edit] ^ Cipollone R, Ascenzi P, Tomao P, Imperi F, Visca P (2008).

It provides commentary and analysis on religious, social, and political issues relevant to Muslims in the United Kingdom and the wider Western context, presented in an orthodox and scholarly manner. The platform was founded in response to what it viewed as attempts by the British government to impose British values on Muslim communities. It operates as an independent initiative but is supported by the Muslim Research and Development Foundation. Its stated aim has been to provide a framework for a British Muslim identity rather than focusing on sectarian divisions. In addition to its publications, Islam21c has been involved in advocacy efforts, public campaigns, and protests concerning issues affecting Muslim communities in Britain. History[edit] Islam21c was established in 2006 by a network associated with Haitham al-Haddad as a platform for Muslim perspectives in Britain, gradually evolving into an independent entity focused on religious and social commentary.[1] In 2015, a government press release under Prime Minister David Cameron described its Chief Editor, Salman Butt, as a 'hate preacher,' an accusation later revealed through a parliamentary question to be based on claims that the site hosted content contrary to 'British values.'[2] Butt challenged this designation in court, and after six years of litigation, the UK government issued an apology.[3] In 2024, the Civil Service Muslim Network cited Islam21c as a useful source in Ramadan guidance distributed across Whitehall, but the guidance was suspended by Deputy Prime Minister Oliver Dowden following criticism that events linked to the website had included antisemitic tropes.[4] Questions about ownership were raised by The Daily Telegraph, prompting the Muslim Research and Development Foundation (MRDF) to clarify that it did not own or operate the site, despite earlier financial filings describing it as an 'endorsed project,' later revised to a 'supported project.'[4] Butt has since explained that Islam21c operates independently from MRDF to maintain the freedom to engage in activities such as political advocacy, which registered charities are restricted from undertaking.[5] In addition to commentary, Islam21c has been active in civic discussions, participating in government consultations on issues such as Relationship and Sex Education (RSE), homeschooling, and integration, while also organizing public debates—including one on the EU Referendum—and staging demonstrations in response to international crises such as the conflict in Aleppo in 2016.[6] Topic structure[edit] Founded partly in response to perceived efforts by the British government to promote 'British values' among Muslim communities, Islam21c functions as a platform for discussion and analysis of religious, social, and political issues from an orthodox perspective.[7][8] While its coverage extends to international affairs and wider challenges facing Muslims in Western societies, the website places particular emphasis on issues affecting Muslims in the United Kingdom.[9] Its content is primarily aimed at younger professionals and addresses the development of a distinct British Muslim identity, considering not only religious exclusion but also intersecting forms of marginalization, including racial, economic, and gender-based inequalities.[7][10] The site has occasionally encouraged political engagement, suggesting that Muslims explore independent representation and participation in formal political processes to better understand governance and advocacy.[5] Some observers, such as the National Secular Society, have described certain content on the platform as 'hardline' and 'homophobic.'[4] Islam21c has also been critical of the UK government's Prevent programme, arguing that it may contribute to alienation among young people and increase vulnerability to radicalization.[11] References[edit] ^ Dawood, Iman (2025).
